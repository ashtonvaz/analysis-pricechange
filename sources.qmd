The data for this project was obtained from (Stooq)[https://stooq.com/db/h/].  It provides free historical market price data for various markets such as U.S. NASADQ, U.S. NYSE, U.K, Japan, andHong Kong among others.  Each symbol's available data is storied in a single file.  Data is availiable for daily, hourly, and five minute intervals.

No modification to the data has been performed at present and data is being used as available through as_tibble(read.csv()).  Data import process needs to be completed that will read the data from all symbols, rename column name so that they can be used in R, and merge all symbol data into a single data frame or tibble.  Additional columns will then be added that will contain the calculated price change delta for various time periods, e.g. day, week, month, quarter, year, etc.
